I'm a second year PhD student in EECS at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Aleksander MÄ…dry](https://madry.mit.edu).
I received my BS in computer science from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu), and spent two great years at [Robust Intelligence](https://www.robustintelligence.com) before starting my PhD.

I am interested in how we can develop machine learning models that can be safely deployed, with a focus on robustness to distribution shifts.
In particular, I would like to understand how we can harness large-scale pre-training (e.g., CLIP, GPT) to develop robust task-specific models.
Outside of research, I enjoy climbing, volleyball and tennis.
